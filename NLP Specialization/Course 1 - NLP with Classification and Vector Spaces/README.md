# Natural Language Processing Specialization

Break into the NLP space. Master cutting-edge NLP techniques through four hands-on courses! This four-course specialization will help you understand NLP fundamentals, apply them, and build a career in AI.

  - **Classification and Vector Spaces**
  - Probabilistic Models
  - Sequence Models
  - Attention Models **(Currently unavailable under development)**

# Course 1 - Classification and Vector Spaces!

In Course 1 of the Natural Language Processing Specialization, offered by deeplearning.ai, you will:

a) Perform sentiment analysis of tweets using logistic regression and then na√Øve Bayes, 
b) Use vector space models to discover relationships between words and use PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the vector space and visualize those relationships, and
c) Write a simple English to French translation algorithm using pre-computed word embeddings and locality sensitive hashing to relate words via approximate k-nearest neighbor search.
