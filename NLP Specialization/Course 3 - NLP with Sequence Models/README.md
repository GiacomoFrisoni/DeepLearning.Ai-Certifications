# Natural Language Processing Specialization

Break into the NLP space. Master cutting-edge NLP techniques through four hands-on courses! This four-course specialization will help you understand NLP fundamentals, apply them, and build a career in AI.

  - Classification and Vector Spaces
  - Probabilistic Models
  - **Sequence Models**
  - Attention Models **(Currently unavailable under development)**

# Course 3 - Sequence Models!

In Course 3 of the Natural Language Processing Specialization, offered by deeplearning.ai, you will:

a) Train a neural network with GLoVe word embeddings to perform sentiment analysis of tweets,
b) Generate synthetic Shakespeare text using a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) language model,
c) Train a recurrent neural network to perform named entity recognition (NER) using LSTMs with linear layers, and 
d) Use so-called ‘Siamese’ LSTM models to compare questions in a corpus and identify those that are worded differently but have the same meaning. 
 
Please make sure that you’ve completed Course 2 and are familiar with the basics of TensorFlow. If you’d like to prepare additionally, you can take Course 1: Neural Networks and Deep Learning of the Deep Learning Specialization.
