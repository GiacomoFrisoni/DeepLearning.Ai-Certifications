# Natural Language Processing Specialization

Break into the NLP space. Master cutting-edge NLP techniques through four hands-on courses! This four-course specialization will help you understand NLP fundamentals, apply them, and build a career in AI.

  - Classification and Vector Spaces
  - **Probabilistic Models**
  - Sequence Models
  - Attention Models **(Currently unavailable under development)**

# Course 2 - Probabilistic Models!

In Course 2 of the Natural Language Processing Specialization, offered by deeplearning.ai, you will:

a) Create a simple auto-correct algorithm using minimum edit distance and dynamic programming,
b) Apply the Viterbi Algorithm for part-of-speech (POS) tagging, which is important for computational linguistics,
c) Write a better auto-complete algorithm using an N-gram language model, and 
d) Write your own Word2Vec model that uses a neural network to compute word embeddings using a continuous bag-of-words model.
