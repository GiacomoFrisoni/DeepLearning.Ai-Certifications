# Course 4: Convolutional Neural Networks

## Description
You will: - Understand how to build a convolutional neural network, including recent variations such as residual networks. - Know how to apply convolutional networks to visual detection and recognition tasks. - Know to use neural style transfer to generate art. - Be able to apply these algorithms to a variety of image, video, and other 2D or 3D data. This is the fourth course of the Deep Learning Specialization.

- #### Week 1: Foundations of Convolutional Neural Networks
	- Learn to implement the foundational layers of CNNs (pooling, convolutions) and to stack them properly in a deep network to solve multi-class image classification problems.
- #### Week 2: Deep convolutional models: case studies
	- Learn about the practical tricks and methods used in deep CNNs straight from the research papers.
- #### Week 3: Object detection
	- Learn how to apply your knowledge of CNNs to one of the toughest but hottest field of computer vision: Object detection.
- #### Week 4: Special applications: Face recognition & Neural style transfer
	- Discover how CNNs can be applied to multiple fields, including art generation and face recognition. Implement your own algorithm to generate art and recognize faces!
