# Deep Learning Course Structure
- ### Course 1: Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization
  - ##### If you want to break into cutting-edge AI, this course will help you do so. Deep learning engineers are highly sought after, and mastering deep learning will give you numerous new career opportunities. Deep learning is also a new "superpower" that will let you build AI systems that just weren't possible a few years ago.
- ### Course 2: Structuring Machine Learning Projects
  - ##### This course will teach you the "magic" of getting deep learning to work well. Rather than the deep learning process being a black box, you will understand what drives performance, and be able to more systematically get good results. You will also learn TensorFlow.
- ### Course 3: Convolutional Neural Networks
- ### Course 4: Neural Networks and Deep Learning
- ### Course 5: Sequence Models
