# Course 1: Neural Networks and Deep Learning

## Description:
In this course, you will learn the foundations of deep learning. When you finish this class, you will: - Understand the major technology trends driving Deep Learning - Be able to build, train and apply fully connected deep neural networks - Know how to implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks - Understand the key parameters in a neural network's architecture This course also teaches you how Deep Learning actually works, rather than presenting only a cursory or surface-level description. So after completing it, you will be able to apply deep learning to a your own applications. If you are looking for a job in AI, after this course you will also be able to answer basic interview questions. This is the first course of the Deep Learning Specialization.

- #### Week 1: Introduction to deep learning
	- Be able to explain the major trends driving the rise of deep learning, and understand where and how it is applied today.
- #### Week 2: Neural Networks Basics
	- Learn to set up a machine learning problem with a neural network mindset. Learn to use vectorization to speed up your models.
- #### Week 3: Shallow neural networks
	- Learn to build a neural network with one hidden layer, using forward propagation and backpropagation.
- #### Week 4: Deep Neural Networks
	- Understand the key computations underlying deep learning, use them to build and train deep neural networks, and apply it to computer vision.
