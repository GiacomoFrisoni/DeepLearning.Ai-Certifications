# Course 3: Data Pipelines with TensorFlow Data Services

## Description
In this third course, you’ll use a suite of tools in TensorFlow to more effectively leverage data and train your model. You’ll learn how to leverage built-in datasets with just a few lines of code, use APIs to control how you split your data, and process all types of unstructured data. 

- #### Week 1: Data Pipelines with TensorFlow Data Services
	- You'll learn about the types of data that you would normally come across when doing machine learning.
- #### Week 2: Exporting your data into the training pipeline
	- This week you’re going to start looking at the code for using the data with input pipelines!
- #### Week 3: Performance
	- How you load your data into your model can have a huge impact on how efficiently the model trains. You'll learn how to handle your data input to avoid bottlenecks, race conditions and more!
- #### Week 4: Publishing your datasets
	- This week let’s learn about how you can share your data with the world in a way that’s easy for others to consume!
